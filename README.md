# **TubeDownloader**
A simple way of **downloading** Videos and Playlists from **YouTube**.
## Introduction
Sometimes, downloading videos from YouTube can be frustrating because most free programs have limitations.
uTube Downloader is a **free** and **open-source** program that allows users to easily download videos and playlists without worrying about limitations.

For now, the program only has two file types, **MP4** and **MP3**. I'll make sure to add more later.
## Installation
1. Download the archive and unzip it.
2. Run the executable.
